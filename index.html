                  In botany, a fruit is the seed-bearing structure in flowering plants that is formed from the ovary after flowering. Fruits are the means by 
                which flowering plants disseminate their seeds. The fleshy or dry ripened ovary of a flowering plant, enclosing the seed or seeds. It can also be 
                defined as the usually edible reproductive body of a seed plant.

                 <em>Genus Malus</em>. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, <em>Malus sieversil</em>, is still found today.The apple is 
                 also my <em>Favorite Fruit of all.</em>

             <h3> 2) Pineapple: </h3>
             <p>
                 The Pineapple <em>(Ananas comosus)</em> is a tropical plant with an edible fruit; it is the most economically significant plant in the family <em>
                 Bromeliceae</em>. where it has been cultivated for many centuries. The introduction of pineapple to Europe in the 17th century made it a 
                 significant cultural icon of luxury. The Pineapple is a really <em>tasty fruit</em>
             </p>
             <h3>3) Avocado: </h3>
              <p>
                  The Avocado <em>(Persea americana)</em> is a tree originating in the Americas which is likely native to the highland regions of south-central 
                  Mexico to <i>Guatemala</i>. It is classified as a member of the flowering plant <i>family Lauraceae</i>. The fruit of the plant, also called an 
                  Avocado, is botanically a large berry containing a single large seed.
              </p>
             <h3> 4) Banana:</h3>
             <p>
                A banana is an elongated, edible fruit - botanically a berry - produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the <em>genus 
                 Musa</em>. In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "Plantains", distinguishing them from <b>dessert bananas.</b>
             </p>
             <h3> 5)Blackberries:</h3>
             <p> 
                The blackberry is an edible fruit produced by many species in the genus <i>Rubus</i> in the <i>family Rosaceae</i>,hybrids among these species 
                 within the subgenus <i>Rubus</i>, and hybrids with subgenera <i>Rubus</i> and <i>Idaeobatus</i>. The taxonomy of blackberries has historically 
                 been confused because because of hybridization and apomixis,so that species have often been grouped together and called <b>species 
                 aggregates.</b>
             </p>
             <h3> 6) Coconut:</h3>
             <p>
                The Coconut,despite having the word  "nut" in its name, is <b>a fruit - not a nut.</b>In fact, a coconut falls under a subcategory known as drupes,
                 which are defined as fruits that have an inner flesh and seed surrounded by a hard shell. This includes a variety of fruits, such as peaches,
                 pears,walnuts and almonds. The Coconut is a very fleshy and tasty fruit.
